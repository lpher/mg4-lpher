## Devlog
The model-view-control pattern decouples the Player code from other game systems by isolating responsibilities to their own classes. The Player Jump() method for example handles the player’s jumping behavior, such as applying upward force and determining how high the player jumps. This behavior directly defines what the player does in the game. In contrast, the Player code is not responsible for adding points to the score or updating the score UI, as those behaviors are handled by the ScoreController and other view classes like ScoreUI. This separation ensures that the Player remains focused on its own control logic rather than the responsibilities of other systems like presentation or scoring. The class that defines the control is the Player class as the class represents the game logic the controller represents. The class holds an if statement on whether to call the Jump() method to make the Player game object jump. This is reading the input from the player and deciding whether jumping should happen or not. The classes that define the view are the ScoreUI and ScoreAudio classes as they represent the UI and sound that the view represents. Using the ScoreController as a Singleton ensures there is a single source of truth for the player’s score, while events provide a decoupled communication channel between the controller and the views. For example, the ScoreController raises the OnScoreChanged event inside AddPoint(), and both ScoreUI and ScoreAudio independently subscribe to this event to update the score text and play a sound, allowing the controller to communicate with the views without directly referencing them.
